      <description>The main goal of Dr. Woteki’s conference speech and our team’s subsequent paper in the Annual Review of Nutrition was to provide a historical overview of important events both before and after the 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health by looking more closely at five general domains: the social environment, the food environment, nutrition science, public health data, and policy events.</description>

      <description>The 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health (WHC) had a significant influence on the direction of food and nutrition policy in the United States. The conference produced recommendations leading to federal legislation and programs to alleviate hunger and malnutrition, improve consumers’ nutrition knowledge through education and labeling, and monitor the nutritional status of the population. Fifty years later, its legacy was revisited at a conference convened by Harvard University and Tufts University.</description>

      <description>In the second section of our paper, we examined what policy makers discussed in the 1969 White House Conference. To garner some high-level insights, we used tidytext – a package developed for natural language processing in the R open-source software language – to visualize a network of textual relations in the WHC Report. This process entails cleaning and preprocessing the textual data from the WHC Report (i.e. selective lemmatization and removal of stop words), quantifying the number of unique words in the corpus, constructing bigrams based on how many times words co-occur adjacent to one another in the text, and then constructing a network of textual relations comprised of the nodes and word co-occurrences.</description>
